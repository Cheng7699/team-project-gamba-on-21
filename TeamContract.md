# Team Contract

This contract is subject to change currently.
### Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

* We will use Instagram as our primary communication channel. 
  * The project repo will be the secondary communications channel.
* Messages should be responded to within 2 days, (for messages addressed to the group) reactions (with emojis) is equivalent to acknowledgement, should be
from ASAP to 2 days max.
  * Reactions rather than Instagram's Read function to avoid cases where someone leaves Instagram on in their browser and 'reading' an unread message. 
  * The project repo should be checked approx. every 2 days. If unable, try to keep checking at least 2 times a week.
* Messages should be sent to the group chat if someone has something to announce or notify. (Examples: if they think they won't be able to meet a deadline, if they have to miss lecture, etc.)

* Respectful and inclusive behaviour: Be adults and don't be a dick.

### [Other Categories of norms and expectations go here]

* Based on your previous teamwork experiences, what other behaviours do you agree upon as a team?
    - some examples of possible additional team norms and expectations are included in the sample team contract in case your team needs some help getting ideas for what else you want to include.
    - (To help with overall progress awareness) At the end of work sessions, individual or group, regardless of whether any code was pushed or commited, a message should be put in the Instagram group chat stating: file, intent, progress, plans. (e.g. Working on X ability of Y file(s), completed halfway but met roadblock Z, will continue working on this at T time)
---

## Decision Making

* Decisions will be made via voting if there is an objection, if there is none then no vote is needed.
  * If a person is outvoted on technical/design issue but remains convinced of their correctness, they can go to office hours and get an opinion from more knowledgeable persons. Upon which the issue will be rediscussed with the instructors' opinions.
---
## Conflict resolution

* Talk it out or See above.
---

## Accountability
* Communication is Key !!!!! Make noise if you have problems! Ask! Annoy the TAs or smth. DO NOT suffer quietly and then say hey I couldn't figure it out one day before the deadline. 
* Each team member is responsible for completing their share of the work in a timely manner, seeking assistance from teammates/TAs/instructors when required, and also to speak up when they think someone else is making a mistake.
* One should also request parts that they are more comfortable with over parts they don't know as well to improve effectivity and lower chances of bugs.
* Checking Other's Code! PRs in this repo need to be checked and approved by at least 1 other person to be able to merge the PR! Notify the gc after you make a pull request.
* PRs SHOULD BE CHECKED and responded to WITHIN ONE DAY!!
